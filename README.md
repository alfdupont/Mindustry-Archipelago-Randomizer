Last update: 2026-06-03

This repo is a fork of Anuken's Mindustry (https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) and has been modified to be used with Archipelago. Visit their repository for more information.

To generate a World(APworld), you will need to install the Mindustry World into your Archipelago custom_worlds folder. You can find the Mindustry World release here -> https://github.com/JohnMahglass/Archipelago-Mindustry/releases

### What has been changed from the vanilla game? <a name="introduction" />

- Save data are separated from vanilla game so that playing Archipelago doesn't erase your vanilla saves. (You should still backup your saves as this is in development)
- Most node from the research tree has been replaced with location checks.
- A "Victory" node has been added, researching this node will inform Archipelago that the player has completed their goal. If both planet are selected as a campaign, each victory nodes need to be researched to complete the goal.
- A new menu has been added in Settings to configure Archipelago's settings.
- You can use the chat to send messages to other client (If they support it).
- Use '/help' in the client to list all client commands.
- It is not possible to construct a fabricator type block if the associated unit has not been researched as well on Erekir planet.
- The research tree now shows every nodes name. This change makes it easier to plan a route if you need to get to a specific location.
